    "body": "I would like to suggest supporting not only the `server_name`, but also permit user names to be included.  This would provide excellent support for peer-to-peer applications for protocols that use `user@domain.name` identities and whose design can work peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nThere are [TLS relays using SNI](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy) that need no knowledge about the content of the TLS stream, so they are no men in the middle.  With user names added into ESNI, it would be possible to do similar things with registered users; [SIP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261) springs to mind as an example, because phones/terminals `REGISTER` [to a domain's server](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-10.3) that subsequently [relays](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#page-12) `INVITE` and other messages between them but is effectively a MITM, which can modify traffic and tap [SDP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566)-transmitted [keys](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#section-5.12) and [communication end points](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#section-4.1).\r\n\r\nThe general story is of course that end-to-end encryption is better than hop-by-hop encryption, as in current uses of TLS.  Peers representing users that register with an intermediate server sound like a good opportunity to be doing that.  All that is required is a way of deciding where to forward TLS traffic, without changing its contents.  ESNI comes really close to that goal (if it adds user names)."

The draft does address this in section 7.5.2. \"Avoid widely-deployed shared secrets\", but I missed that. Additionally, the draft uses the term \"anonymity set\" only once, in section 6.1. \"Misconfiguration and Deployment Concerns\".\r\n\r\nThe explanation Ben Schwartz wrote on the list is very clear:\r\n\r\n\"The record_digest, like the ESNIConfig itself, is intended to be constant across all domains that form an anonymity set (i.e. O(1) ESNIConfigs per CDN).  Thus, the record_digest reveals no additional information to an onlooker who can observe the server IP.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps a short section on anonymity sets would clarify this. I think some combination of section 7.5.2 and the last paragraph of the introduction would work."

    "body": "[This was split out of #199 as the possibly more controversial idea. It's a simplification but does make configs larger. Also it sits on top of #198 and #200. Ignore the first two comments to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe have two layers of parameter negotiation. Multiple KeyShareEntry values in an ESNIConfig, and multiple ESNIConfig values in an ESNIConfigs. We only need one mechanism, so store only one KeyShareEntry in an ESNIConfig.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies representing client and server configuration, which simplies implementation internals as well as interchange formats. Right now, on the server, configuration has two layers of lists, something like list(tuple(ESNIConfig, list(PrivateKey))). Now the server maintains list(tuple(ESNIConfig, PrivateKey)).\r\n\r\nNote also that draft-farrell-tls-pemesni-00 has this oddity around what to do if the ESNIKeys contains multiple keys. This is particularly a nuisance because a single standalone PRIVATE KEY / ESNIKEY pair is not usable because the server has committed to answering to *all* keys in the ESNIKeys. The server must consume multiple PEM files, match up the ESNIKeyses, and then assert that it has a complete set.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, in the likely case that the server only supports one version and one set of extensions, the non-key ESNI config bits (notably the public name; the rest is small) are repeated for every named group. However, the public name should not be that large and servers should only need one or two groups (see https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html)."

    "body": "[This PR sits on top of #198. Ignore the first commit to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe currently have two levels of mechanisms for servers to advertise multiple sets of parameters. First, each ESNIConfig has multiple keys in it, so a server can suport multiple groups at once. These keys are stapled together so a single HTTPSSVC record, etc., delivers the entire configuration.\r\n\r\nAt a layer above that, we have a version/extension-based mechanism. The server may advertise multiple ESNIConfigs to cover multiple versions of ESNI (hopefully we won't need this mechanism after standardization, but it's quite useful for draft versions) or multiple sets of mandatory extensions. Unlike the group advertisement, these are each in separate configuration units, so, e.g., they may be in multiple HTTPSSVC records.\r\n\r\nThis PR flattens the two mechanisms into one. Each ESNIConfig now has a single KeyShareEntry. Multiple groups and multiple versions are expressed in the same way: multiple ESNIConfig structures. It then introduces a wrapper ESNIConfigs structure which is the new unit of ESNI configuration delivered in HTTPSSVC, etc.\r\n\r\nThis should be paired with a change to draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc to carry an ESNIConfigs, not an ESNIConfig (formerly ESNIKeys). (@bemasc FYI)\r\n\r\nThis fixes a number of oddities:\r\n\r\n- Client and server need to maintain two levels of configuration. On the server, the structure has two layers of lists, something like list(tuple(ESNIConfig, list(PrivateKey))). Now the server maintains list(tuple(ESNIConfig, PrivateKey)). Conversely, the client needed two negotiation loops whereas now it only requires one.\r\n\r\n- Logic across different layers of the client stack now more reliably have the full ESNI configuration available in one unit.\r\n\r\n  In the old design, a single ESNIConfig, rather than a set of them, would be correlated with an IP address or CNAME, by way of the HTTPSSVC record. A server which supportsed multiple ESNI versions or mandatory extension sets would advertise several HTTPSSVC records, potentially with different IPs. That means the DNS and transport connection logic must know about TLS capabitilies to pick the right HTTPSSVC record.\r\n\r\n  In the new design, the server includes all its variations at once, so the DNS and transport logic can reasonably pick an HTTPSSVC purely based on whether the TLS stack supports ESNI, rather than the full set of capabilities. That is, the text in [0] does not work right now, and this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, in the likely case that the server only supports one version and one set of extensions, the non-key ESNI config bits (notably the public name; the rest is small) are repeated for every named group. However, the public name should not be that large and servers should only need one or two groups[1].\r\n\r\nThis also does make ESNIConfigs and ESNIConfig separate structures, which is slightly goofy. Alternate names if folks prefer:\r\n\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIConfig/ESNIBundle\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIKey/ESNIConfig\r\n\r\n[0] https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc-00#section-8.1.1\r\n[1] https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html"

    "body": "The draft has provisions for GREASE ESNI extensions, per \"Do not stick out\". However, this is not very effective if an attacker can distinguish a GREASE ESNI extension from a real one.\r\n\r\n#154 tried to address this, but it doesn't work if the (public) ESNI record is known. There's also a simpler attack: replay the ClientHello with one byte of ciphertext corrupted. ESNI currently distinguishes key mismatch from decrypt failure, with the latter resulting in an alert. We can fix that by saying decrypt failure should behave like key mismatch. This still leaves record_digest.\r\n\r\nThe natural fix is to drop record_digest in favor of trial decryption. The cost is the server must perform a DH operation per known key. The number of keys the server needs depends on its DNS TTLs and key rotation. (I think it's 1 + ceil(dns_ttl / time_between_rotation), plus some leeway[*].)\r\n\r\nInstead, we can keep a key name, but make the space dense. Suppose we replace it with a B-bit \"key phase\". The server picks a random starting key phase. Then, each time it rotates the keys, it increments the phase, with wraparound. The server then gets 2<sup>B</sup> keys for free. If it needs more, it still needs trial decryption but gains a 2<sup>B</sup> multiplicative factor in the cost. On the flip side, an individual GREASE extension with a random key phase has a 1/2<sup>B</sup> chance of colliding with a particular ESNI key.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we actually need that many live keys, so B = 2 is probably plenty. Or even B = 1 if we say you should just rotate slower than your DNS TTL.\r\n\r\n[*] Note the robustness mechanism means that server doesn't need to cover _all_ clients with stale keys. The retry is expensive, so the server still needs to cover _almost all_ of them, but it can cut off the long tail."

The spec currently says:\r\n\r\n> The ClientEncryptedSNI.encrypted_sni value is then computed using the usual TLS 1.3 AEAD:\r\n>\r\n>     encrypted_sni = AEAD-Encrypt(key, iv, ClientHello.KeyShareClientHello, ClientESNIInner)\r\n>\r\n> Where ClientHello.KeyShareClientHello is the body of the extension but not including the extension header.\r\n\r\nClientHello.KeyShareClientHello is not defined in this document. At first I thought it would cover ClientEncryptedSNI.key_share, but that seemed odd.\r\n\r\nLater I found that it refers to the Key Share extension defined in [RFC 8446, Section 4.2.8. Key Share](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.2.8). Perhaps this reference could be added?\r\n\r\nOn a related note, `HKDF-Extract(0, Z)` should probably become `HKDF-Extract(\"\", Z)` or be explicit about the salt as is done in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-7.1 (or https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869#section-2.2)."

    "body": "Attackers cannot successfully replay a ClientHello and ESNI extension and establish a connection with the server. However, they can replay a ClientHello and examine whether it triggers a positive response. This can be used to check whether a server is still present. This is a particular concern when using ESNI in local discovery mode, where merely eliciting a response would be enough to give away a server's presence.\r\n\r\nTo protect against such attacks, I consider adding two elements in the ESNI:\r\n\r\n1) A 64 bit timestamp, set to the date at which the client sent the message.\r\n2) The IPv6 address from which the client is sending the message.\r\n\r\nThe timestamp prevents repeat of a message over time. The IPv6 address prevents repeat of the message from a different location. I mention IPv6 here because of NAT, of course.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Should that be encoded as part of `ClientEncryptedSNI` or `ClientESNIInner`? Or should it just be encoded as a separate ClientHello extension?"

    "body": "If each client receives a unique ESNI key from a DNS provider, it is possible to link every usage of this key to the same client. It seems feasible that online services, as well as passive observers of the network traffic, can exploit such a practice for user tracking.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the privacy protections of this draft, we should describe these privacy risks in the draft. Furthermore, I recommend a clear restriction on the clients’ caching durations of ESNI keys. For example, clients MUST NOT cache ESNI keys longer than 24 hours and as privacy protection, it is RECOMMENDED to cache ESNI keys only for 10 minutes."

    "body": "To simplify implementation, the record_digest can be eliminated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. In ESNIKeys, provide a server-assigned 32 bit id.  Servers are free to manage that id space as they see fit e.g. to optimize lookup in a history of rotating keys.  However the server MAY obscure any structure in the numbering in any convenient manner.  As a further optimization, move all fixed length fields before the variable length fields and order them such that natural alignment is achieved (as per IETF tradition).\r\n\r\n2. In ClientEncryptedSNI, insert the 32 bit id right after the Ciphersuite, making it part of the fixed-length part of the structure.  The record_digest field and its calculation is removed, thus reducing the size of the ESNI extension.\r\n\r\n3. In ESNIContents, just use the full record instead of hashing it separately.  This costs a few extra blocks of hash invocations (as the cache record_digest can no longer be cached for each hash algorithm), but simplifies the code.  Alternatively, record_digest can be kept for this non-transmitted field to preserve that caching opportunity."

The CRC32 algorithm used in RFC1952 (gzip), ISO 3309 and ITU-T V.42 is optimized for this task, widely available in software and hardware, and likely to already be implemented in ESNI using systems for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThis would also remove the only part of the draft that requires a specific single cryptographic algorithm, thereby making the specification algorithm agile without introducing any new algorithm registries for IANA to maintain."

This has the additional benefit of allowing different client-facing servers to use different rotating private DH keys.\r\n\r\nThis eliminates the issues with CNAMEs, individual query domain holders having to make changes, DNS namespace issues etc.\r\n\r\nFor example a large hoster wishing to provide cover for some clients by having their primary / CDN front ends offer ESNI for all requests can then simply enable the code on their server then add the ESNI records.  They can even do this gradually over a large pool of servers, thus having some servers with different (or no) ESNI support during each careful rollout of ESNI software upgrades.\r\n\r\nIn practice the following conventions would be used:\r\n\r\n1. Any ESNI server IP must have exactly one PTR record (typically pointing to the hoster domain, such as a typical systematic CDN node DNS name).  Lets call this name ptrnam.dom\r\n\r\n2. The ESNI records would be under _esni.ptrnam.dom\r\n\r\n3. As with most PTR records ptrnam.dom is expected to have exactly one AAAA or A record pointing back at the same IP (if the starting IP is IPv6 only AAAA need to satisfy this, if IPv4 only A, the same ptrnam.dom can be used for one IPv4 and one IPv6 address if the ESNI records would be the same).\r\n\r\n4. For address-less server types such as tor hidden services, the ESNI records would be published via whatever DNS or DNS-like mechanism is used for that transport, or queried by sending a DNS query for the record to the target, allowing the target to respond within that transport.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n- B1. Large client-facing servers such as CDNs and shared IP hosters can deploy ESNI without having to negotiate DNS changes with all their customers (in fact with any of their customers).\r\n\r\n- B2. Operators of large pools of client-facing servers such as CDNs can roll out ESNI support and ESNI implementation upgrades in a piecemeal and controlled manner similar to how other system updates are rolled out.  Simply because each IP address will have its own ESNI records.\r\n\r\n- B3. ESNI key rotation becomes much simpler as there is no need to synchronize it between different servers in a pool (except where a pure layer 1/2/3 load balancer shares a single IP among multiple physical/virtual servers, such as the layer 2 HALinux scheme).\r\n\r\n- B4. ESNI private key protection can be much stronger when it is not shared among all the servers.  The private key may be kept in protected hardware and/or in volatile RAM.  The latter case would require clients to fall back to a different A or AAAA record until the DNS entries for now forgotten keys to have expired, but only in case of a server crash or similar event.\r\n\r\n- B5. Client queries for ESNI records do not reveal the actual query domain that will be encrypted, only the IP address to which the ESNI extension will be sent.\r\n\r\n- B6. The whole discussion about _esni prefix or no _esni prefix becomes a lot simpler when there is no need to put ESNI records in every end query domain, only domains of the client-facing servers, allowing to keep the unprefixed TXT name space clean for existing uses such as SPF.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n\r\n- P1: Clients will have to postpone the _esni DNS query until after receiving the answer to the A or AAAA query, thus adding an extra DNS roundtrip before the first connection to a name.  The usual DNS caching hierarchy should mitigate this.  In particular for popular CDNs, a client will typically use the same handful of IPs for lots of unrelated traffic, thus getting the ESNI records in its local cache.\r\n\r\n- P2: VM hosting/Physical hosting/connectivity providers not granting PTR name assignment control to IP address customers will cause the same problems as for other protocols (such as mail) and should thus be under the same or greater pressure to add that service.  However since the greatest ESNI benefit is with IPs shared among many unrelated domains, and the operators of such IPs typically have full IP space ownership or the leverage to get PTR records where normal customers cannnot, the effect on ESNI deployment should be limited.\r\n\r\n- P3: This may or may not make it easier to do spoofing attacks, as an MitM attacker can spoof DNS responses either for the A/AAAA records of a target query domain (pointing to servers entirely under the attackers control, including legitimate ESNI records for that server) OR spoof the ESNI records of a server address for which the attacker has obtained traffic intercept ability.  However these can be secured with the same DNS countermeasures already applicable to those DNS domains.\r\n\r\n- P4: query domains wishing to remain available in massively blocking markets (the kind that would not hesitate to block an entire CDN to stop access to a single web page) may have more difficulty opting out of ESNI so such blocking filters can recognize them as a permitted service.\r\n"

It would work as follow:\r\n\r\n1) Authorized clients know the ESNI public key of the private server, which is otherwise kept secret.\r\n\r\n2) Client initiates a DTLS session or a QUIC connection by broadcasting a message containing ESNI extension targeting the specific server.\r\n\r\n3) Servers only respond if the recognize their key and name in the extension.\r\n\r\nESNI almost works as is for that, but not quite. First, the \"record_digest\" component allows identification and tracking of the server.

This might unblock browsers from defaulting to HTTPS.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "The document currently states:\r\n\r\n> Servers operating in Split Mode SHOULD have DNS configured to return the same A (or AAAA) record for all ESNI-enabled servers they service. This yields an anonymity set of cardinality equal to the number of ESNI-enabled server domains supported by a given client-facing server. Thus, even with SNI encryption, an attacker which can enumerate the set of ESNI-enabled domains supported by a client-facing server can guess the correct SNI with probability at least 1/K, where K is the size of this ESNI-enabled server anonymity set. This probability may be increased via traffic analysis or other mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI think this is too restrictive. If I have 100000 names and 100 IPs and for all queries I randomly return four out of my 100 IPs chosen randomly, I still provide the same anonymity set but I violate the SHOULD. How about: `Content providers operating in Split Mode SHOULD ensure that the A and AAAA records for ESNI-enabled server names do not allow identifying the server name from the IP address. This can for example be achieved by always returning the same records for all ESNI-enabled names, or by having the function that picks addresses from a pool not depend on the server name. This yields an anonymity set...`"

From reading RFC 7838, I'm not sure the SNI and DNS names do not match when you're querying an alternate name.

    "body": "(WG email coming shortly.)\r\n\r\nCloses #82.\r\n\r\nESNI has different compatibility characteristics than most TLS\r\nextensions. It involves client state, and encrypting the SNI makes the\r\nClientHello unusable for servers that do not have the key or do not\r\nimplement ESNI. This breaks common rollout and rollback strategies and\r\nplaces strong requirements on DNS/server consistency. This makes\r\ndeploying ESNI risky for servers.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to reduce these deployment risks. ESNI is much more\r\nuseful if widely deployed. Moreover, if ESNI is unreliable due to\r\ncomplex requirements on the server, clients will be disincentivized to\r\nimplement it. The DNS/server consistency requirements also\r\ndisincentivize rotating keys (section 7.2.5).\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the notion of a \"public name\" which allows the\r\nclient to receive authenticated signals from the server that the\r\nESNIKeys are out of sync, so clients can safely repair key mismatches.\r\nIt also aligns with existing server behavior before ESNI, so partial\r\nrollouts and rollbacks can also be handled.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the latter also handles MITM scenarios, replacing the\r\nexisting client recommendation:\r\n\r\n>   A Web client client can securely detect case (2) because it will\r\n>   result in a connection which has an invalid identity (most likely)\r\n>   but which is signed by a certificate which does not chain to a\r\n>   publicly known trust anchor.  The client can detect this case and\r\n>   disable ESNI while in that network configuration.\r\n>\r\n>   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-02#section-6.2\r\n\r\nThe public name notion fixes a bug in that text: an attacker could\r\ndisable ESNI on all servers, given the existence of *any* such server."

    "body": "In a large-scale server deployment that benefits the most from ESNI (due to the size of the umbrella under which you would hide the domain names), it is often the case that the largest length of the server name to be supported is *unknown*. That leads such server deployments to use a padded_length of 260 because the longest valid DNS name is 253 characters, bloating the ClientHello.\r\n\r\nIt is beneficial to apply a lightweight compression algorithm to the server name to reduce the overhead.\r\n\r\nSome points to consider:\r\n* We cannot use a pre-learnt dictionary, because what we care is the longest possible length. Compression algorithm using a pre-learnt dictionary assigns longer symbols for rarely used patterns, which means that the worst case is longer than the non-compressed string.\r\n* We can use an adaptive compression algorithm (e.g. lz77, brotli), however they also would not compress well if the server-name is a random-looking string."

    "body": "As of 7bd60fc, Section 3.1 says that in Split Mode, \"the backend server can be an unmodified TLS 1.3 server.\"\r\n\r\nBut I feel that statement is contradicted by:\r\n- Section 5.4: \"In Split Mode, the backend server must know PaddedServerNameList.nonce to echo it back in EncryptedExtensions and complete the handshake. ... backend servers function the same as servers operating in Shared mode.\"\r\n- Section 7.3: \"...the backend server also only has one identity.\"\r\n- Appendix B: \"When operating in Split mode, backend servers will not have access to PaddedServerNameList.sni or ClientESNIInner.nonce...\"\r\n\r\nA standard TLS 1.3 server that has more than one identity (i.e., requires plaintext SNI) won't work as a backend server. Even if the backend server has only one identity and ignores the forwarded encrypted_server_name extension, and therefore returns a default certificate, it seems that the connection will still fail because of the requirement in Section 5.1 that the client \"MUST check that ClientESNIInner.nonce matches the value of the 'encrypted_server_name' extension provided by the server.\" So I propose removing or amending the statement in Section 3.1. I don't see a way to deploy a Split-Mode topology without making the backend server ESNI-aware and doing some exchange along the lines of Appendix B, but I might have missed something.\r\n\r\nAm I correct in thinking that the current Cloudflare deployment is Shared Mode, not Split Mode, despite that Figure 2 looks more like a typical CDN topology? Because the TLS gets terminated at the Cloudflare CDN edge server, and the connection to the Cloudflare customer's web server is done with an independent connection."

(imagine the definition of a TXT record that simply applied to all DNS entries)\r\n* while both TXT and ESNI are 8 bit clean, some people are surprised to learn that about TXT so using a new type may be more robust. Some generic tools processing TXT records would benefit from this.\r\n* TXT is a set of  <= 255 byte strings, defining a new type removes that complexity and reduces overhead\r\n* There was initially concern about the viability of new RRTypes, but I believe people are more comfortable with that now than when the text was drafted."

    "body": "issue #7 briefly discussed the choice of a _esni DNS prefix for the TXT record. I think we should revisit that.\r\n\r\nMy primary concern is that using 2 different names for the addressing and key information makes DNS aliasing un-necessarily complicated.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where www.example.com is a customer of bigHoster.com and bigHoster.com is deploying ESNI for all its customers.\r\n\r\nA classic way to do this is to have www.example.com be a CNAME for host1.bighoster.com\r\n\r\nunfortunately to use bighoster.com's new ESNI infrastructure www.example.com would need to add a CNAME record for _esni.www.example.com as well. So the ESNI deployment requires DNS changes outside of the org deploying ESNI, which is going to limit its deployment, which in turn is going to limit the breadth of its anonymity pool. :(\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've been told that anecdotally putting names under a CNAME is legal but error prone. RFC 1912 seems to have some language that suggests its not even legal (though that is informational).\r\n\r\nIf the ESNI information were instead stored without a prefix then the alias would automatically apply as the CNAME applies to all the RR's of a hostname.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for choosing the prefix was to avoid collisions in the TXT space, so it makes sense to also reopen #40 and use a non TXT RR type if we drop the prefix. I think the consensus is moving towards that being fine.\r\n\r\nThis would also resolve #79 to harmonize esni with existing dns deployments.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I don't know that I can give out my advice here before, so I had written an e-mail to draft-rescorla-tls-esni@ietf.org and that's my first time to send an email to IETF. I don't know whether sending an e-mail is the right thing, so I would paste it here again.\r\n\r\nI'm not a native English speaker, I would apologize for my poor English first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### DNS record disadvantage\r\n\r\n#### 1.Impossible for wildcard A or AAAA record\r\n\r\nIt isn't possible for us to set a txt record for wildcard A or AAAA record (_esni.*.example.com. 60S IN TXT \"...\" \"...\"). \r\nThe same problem as https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-esni/issues/79 mentioned.\r\n\r\n#### 2.Publishing a public key using DNS is very inconvenient and insecure. \r\n\r\nIn general, we can't change the DNS record very conveniently (except some DNS which provide API), so that most domain owners won't change the key very often. \r\n\r\nAnd in some cases, domain owners host their site at host service providers (I don't know how to explain that in English. Host service provider use one physical or virtual server to host many sites) once the provider want to change the ESNI public key, all owners on this server need to change their txt record on time, which is very inconvenient and nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe lack of frequently changing public key and the lack of Perfect Forward Security only provide us little security.\r\n\r\n#### 3.DNS record limited only exist domains can enable ESNI\r\n\r\nAs DNS record is needed to be set, only the owner of a exist and valid domain can enable ESNI.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes we want to use encrypted-sni as a private entry. For example, I configured my server that client hello with the sni \"vps.panel\" would lead to the vps control panel ( I issued a cert for \"vps.panel\" from my own PKI ). Though I configured that the server must verify my identity using a client certificate, I don't want this private sni to be known to the public. But your draft's method won't allow this use case as \"vps.panel\" isn't a valid domain name, so that I won't be able to own this domain and set a DNS record for it.\r\n\r\n#### 4.Local DNS (hosts) won't work\r\n\r\nThe hosts file can only take the place of A and AAAA record and won't be able to set public key in hosts in the near future.\r\n\r\n#### 5.Requirements to the server is too high\r\n\r\nThis ESNI draft requires that the server can the decrypt the sni which is encrypted by any public key. This means that the server has to take hold all ESNI private keys. However, I think that it's not proper.  \r\nTo CDN service provider like Cloudflare, it means that one Cloudflare server has to storage all private ESNI keys of the websites hosted on it.  \r\nIn my opinion, the browser should encrypt the sni using all public keys found in the DNS record and add a few invalid ESNI along with those, to prevent the attacker identify the real sni from the number of public keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Purpose Enhancement - Wall-resistent\r\n\r\nIn some countries (e.g. China, North Korea, Iran) , people may want to use ESNI to break the government's GreatFireWall, which blocks people from visiting some website.\r\n\r\nThe wall isn't just a wall, but a very complicated system which can modify DNS resolve result ( DNSSEC isn't common ). They can simply block all _esni txt record, so that all browsers can' get the public key and downgrade to cleartext-sni.\r\n\r\nIf ESNI can be used with SNI Proxy, it would be a good solution to break the wall. However the DNS record limited only the owner can enable ESNI ( Another disadvantage of DNS :D )\r\n\r\n\r\n### My suggestions\r\n\r\nI think some ideas of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption/ is quite good. One good idea is to use a certificate to authenticate the Client-Facing Server instead of publishing a public key. My main idea is to introduce a series of HTTP headers like HSTS and HPKP. I will give an example below:\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would introduce these headers\r\n( These names may be not proper due to my poor English )\r\n\r\n```\r\nESNI:(preload);(includeSubdomains);max-age=??\r\nIf ESNI header presents in the response, it means this domain enables ESNI. Otherwise, the browser MUST ignore other ESNI-* headers.\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI:preload;includeSubdomains;max-age=31536000\r\n\r\nESNI-Resolve:{address};max-age=??\r\n{address} can be either FQDN or IP(s) the purpose is to hide the real domain during DNS resolve. The server MUST keep this header up-to-date. This header just like a cacheable CNAME record.\r\ne.g. \r\nESNI-Resolve: server233.domain-cdn.com;max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 0.0.0.0/16;max-age=2592000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 1.1.1.1;max-age=2592000\r\n\r\nESNI-Trust:{address or pin-hash};max-age=??\r\n{address} is the same as above. The only difference is that the FQDN can contain wildcard.\r\n{pin-hash} is similar to HPKP's pin-hash.\r\nCan have more than one this header in the HTTP Response. (Explain later)\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI-Trust:fqdn{ *.domain-cdn.com};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:ip{0.0.0.0/16};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:pin-hash{X523zEOQCuEJeU6PzewOGkKCRX+YLvfAsCYJbQubCuE=};max-age=31536000\r\n\r\n\r\nESNI-Policy:{policy};max-age=??\r\n{policy} can be \"force-encrypted-sni\", \"retry-clear-sni\", \"allow-dns-re-resolve\", \"disallow-dns-re-resolve\" defines the action if error happens using ESNI. \r\nCan have more than one this header in the Response. (Explain below)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have more than one header with the same name, but we may construct these in to a structure and encode (e.g.base64) into one header. The header may be very big, but don't worry, only the first response contains it, HTTP2 will automatically compress them into a few bits in the later response.\r\n\r\nWhen the first time I visit https://www.example.com , I just do the normal tls1.3 hand shake with clear-text sni. The server just do what it should do, but the response MUST contain those ESNI headers if ESNI is enabled. The browser MUST remember these headers ( unless in incognito mode )\r\n\r\nWhen the second time I visit https://www.example.com , the browser SHOULD NOT query DNS resolve for www.example.com, instead, it should visit the FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Resolve header. And the browser MUST NOT send clear-text sni in the ClientHello, instead, send a CH without sni or a special CH indicates using ESNI.  The Client-Facing Server  send back certificate, the browser validates the certificate and makes sure the certificate contains at least one FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Trust header. If mismatch, check the ESNI-Policy and determine whether to retry or not. \r\nAnd then re-handshake with the server with encrypted-ClientHello in the 0RTT data or another CH extension. \r\n( similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method )\r\n\r\nMy suggestions' advantages and disadvantages are nearly the same as draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method. It provides PFS, don't need to change the Split-Mode Server and solved some part of DNS sniffing. But the disadvantage is obvious too, the first hand shake can't be encrypted and the ESNI-Resolve may become incorrect over time. It needs to handshake twice, however, it provided PFS and I think it worth it. And if multiple sites are hosted on the same server (e.g.CDN, Host Service Provider), we just need to do the second handshake, which eliminate the risk of DoS attack in some level.... And I think 0RTT symmetric decryption is better than asymmetric decryption.\r\nSetting max-age too big or too small both have some risks, and I don't know how to solve it.\r\n\r\n**If you don't like the idea of authenticating the Client-Facing Server, you can simply replace the ESNI-Trust header's content into a public key and use your method. But I don' think set a static public key is a good idea ( explained in some part of DNS disadvantage ).**\r\n\r\nAll in all, we can't have both efficiency, performance and security,  reliability. You should make up your mind and choose whether to provide perfect security or perfect performance. I prefer the former.\r\n\r\nI know that my idea is similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption than yours. However, you are the candidate for TLS WG, so I hope you can think it over. But I do agree with your idea that \"no need to don't stick out\" or simply \"we can stick out\" :D"

    "body": "Say that you have a server whose policy is that it will accept any KeyShare that is in the overlap between the client and server supported_groups (this isn't really an advisable policy). An on-path to DNS attacker can force you into the weakest joint group by creating an invalid ESNIKeys structure with a key in that group. The client will then send a KeyShare in that group, and you have been undetectably downgraded. Note that this will lead to suppression of SNI (because the client will be encrypting), but many servers don't require SNI. This works even against a non-ESNI servers.\r\n\r\nThere's also a weaker attack in which the client-facing server just sends a weaker share in ESNIKeys. This will be very hard for the server to detect.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem ideal, and I'm not quite sure how to remove it. This seems like an argument for #67 if we can make that work.\r\n\r\nThanks to @tvdmerwe for discussions leading to this.\r\n\r\n@kazuho: ^^\r\n"

HTTP Alternative Services is the obvious way that happens - but Alt-Svc never changes the origin name.\r\n\r\nWhen fetching the ESNI key, do we fetch it from _esni.origin-name or _esni.host-name?\r\n\r\nI think origin-name makes more sense - keeping everything that is an expiicit protocol element in terms of origin eliminates confusion.\r\n\r\nthe counter argument is that you can use alt-svc to do fine grained fanout to providers with different keys (using cdn specific names for them in alt-svc) in a way that is harder to do through the origin name dns controls."

Key generators do not need to care about uniqueness. TLS servers can just look for the matching digest and that's it.\r\n\r\nNote that a server operator can still associate an identifier to the ESNIKeys structure for internal use. The private key will be kept in relation to the structure anyways. So having a private identifier does not complicate things at all."

    "body": "This seems to be somewhat discussed in the draft and in issues, but I fail to see the motivation behind not using the ESNI key to encrypt other extensions such as ALPN. The main concern seems to be around entities seeing the value of decrypted ALPN, but that's still better than ALPN being the clear. Another concern is a middlebox blocking this extension, but if the client decides to fail hard, blocking is better than leaking; and if a client falls back to unencrypted then the connection works regardless. If I'm missing something, can that be clarified in the draft?"

This will cause multiple issues.\r\n\r\n1) There is no IANA registry for prefixes that start with underscores to be used in DNS, so it is valid for existing servers to already be using _esni as part of the FQDN.\r\n2) The TXT record was designed to hold descriptive text, which means operators can already be using it for other descriptions.\r\n3) As described in issue #35 , using a prefix breaks CNAME.\r\n4) TXT requires base64 encoding which adds overhead on the network and recursive resolvers.\r\n\r\nThe generally recommended way to \"stuff it in the DNS\" is to create a new RR type for your data. For example DANE established RR type TLSA (52). There is room in the 16bit IANA registry for another value. The key here is that this prevents systems from misinterpreting the TXT record as something else, and it prevents systems from already using it for something else\r\n\r\nhttps://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-4"

    "body": "traditional SNI is the origin name. You can use an HTTP connect tunnel, traverse a CNAME (or 3), or engage in some alt-svc load balancing and, while these things all change the DNS name you lookup and connect() to, they don't change the SNI.\r\n\r\nwhat about eSNI? the keys are a property of the server, not really the origin. It seems really hard to coordinate this across administrative domains.\r\n\r\nThe case I'm particularly worried about is where more than one hosting provider is in the mix.. ISTM a typical way of doing this is LB'ing DNS responses with CNAMEs. (e.g. 50% of www.example.com gets CNAME www.cdnA.com and 50% gets www.cdnB.com).. We've got folks from 2 CDNs as active contributors here who know better than I, but this kind of level of indirection to get you CDN agility seems pretty common.. we would want cdnA and cdnB to be able to each use their own keys.\r\n\r\nEven without agility, its a pretty common pattern for an origin to maintain control of their own DNS and only delegate to a CDN under load/whatnot and do that via cname...\r\n\r\nthat argues to me to allow _esni TXT records on the server lookup, not just the origin name. Perhaps they could override the _esni at the origin scope but that seems like a way to trigger the misconfiguration fallback path.\r\n\r\nAlso, what about connect tunnels where you do do SNI, but don't traditionally do DNS at all?\r\n\r\n"

It uses a wildcard certificate. Anybody can add a new hostname of any length by creating a new Github account (it might be true that Github some limitation on the length, but that does not necessarily mean that Github shares the maximum length information with the fronting CDN, assuming that it uses a CDN)."

    "body": "I expect that the resistance against ESNIKeys will come from web-site owners worrying about ESNIKeys being additional source of service disruption.\r\n\r\nOne might argue that the probability of disruption becomes 2x because now two resource records (A and _esni) are involved instead of just one. One might argue that the probability is higher than that because there could be more issues with carrying large TXT records than carrying A records. One might argue that the probability is below 2x because the two records are transmitted through the same path.\r\n\r\nAnyways, these arguments are about the quantitative difference about the probability.\r\n\r\nI prefer having a qualitative guarantee, that assures that there would be no increase in the probability of service disruption assuming that the owner of the `_esni` record does not misconfigure the service.\r\n\r\nHaving a checksum and validity period fields that can be validated by the client provides such guarantee.\r\n\r\nChecksum provides protection against accidental corruption.\r\n\r\nValidity period provides protection against misconfiguration or bugs in the DNS servers. It acts as a protection against an outdated ESNIKeys sent by an out-of-sync authoritative server or a buggy resolver causing disruption.\r\n\r\nThe downside of having checksum and validity is that the additional payload (currently 20 bytes, I think we can minimize this to 10 bytes by removing `not_before` (it's not that needed) and changing the type of `not_after` from `uint64` to `uint48`), and that the client would be required to do the validation.\r\n\r\nBut I assume that having qualitative guarantee that the probability of service disruption remains the same is worth the effort.\r\n\r\nCloses #20."

    "body": "Regarding:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- If the EncryptedSNI.label value does not correspond to any known\r\n  SNI encryption key, it MUST abort the connection with an\r\n  \"illegal_parameter\" alert.\r\n  [[OPEN ISSUE: We looked at ignoring the extension but concluded\r\n  this was better.]]\r\n```\r\nRather than aborting, would it make more sense for the server to (optionally?) send a fresh `ESNIKeys` as an extension as part of `HelloRetryRequest`? Example use case would be that for whatever reason (e.g. key compromise?) the server might want to discard a previously advertised `ESNIKeys` before it expires. Not sure if it's worth the added complexity though.\r\n\r\n(With some other changes it could also be used as an alternative way to publish a key at the cost of one round trip, but the usefulness there is probably limited)\r\n"

    "body": "Thank you for working on the draft. I can't be more happy to see someone willing to lead the community towards having a particular ESNI solution.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that omitting the certificate chain and the signature was [one of the options discussed in my draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kazuho-protected-sni-00#section-5.3) (was originally suggested by @siyengar), I am happy to support the proposal and am willing to implement it.\r\n\r\nOTOH, please let me argue here for sending the certificate-chain along with the ESNIKey.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that there is no huge difference in terms of security, there are benefits related to performance in sending the certificate chain along with the ESNIKey.\r\n\r\nIn QUIC, we are discussing how many packets a server can send before the client's address is validated. This is because sending packets to an non-validated address is an vector for amplification attacks. We can resolve the issue by sending the certificate chain along with the ESNIKey and using an encrypted variant of Cached Certificate Extension.\r\n\r\nWe also revive the possibility of doing 0-RTT using semi-static key, because the key will be signed by the certificate.\r\n\r\nI think that providing performance improvement might give people more incentive to start using ESNI."
